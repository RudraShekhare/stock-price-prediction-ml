# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict future stock prices using historical data and machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a reproducible and understandable model pipeline that can be used to forecast the closing price of a stock (e.g., Apple Inc.).
